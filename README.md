This is the code for the paper ['RECON: Relation Extraction using Knowledge Graph Context in a Graph Neural Network'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08694).

Please note, we recieved multiple queries regarding why we have not used BERT as context aggregator instead of GNN. We tried it and performance was quite low (in the range of 0.76 F1Score on Wikidata dataset). Hence we decided to ignore BERT.
